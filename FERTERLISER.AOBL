x is a 2D array, which can also be looked upon as an array of 1D arrays, having 10 rows and 1024 columns. x[0] is the first 1D sub-array which has 1024 elements (there are 10 such 1D sub-arrays in x), and x[0].shape gives the shape of that sub-array, which happens to be a 1-tuple - (1024, ).

On the other hand, x.shape is a 2-tuple which represents the shape of x, which in this case is (10, 1024). x.shape[0] gives the first element in that tuple, which is 10.

Here's a demo with some smaller numbers, which should hopefully be easier to understand.



import numpy as np
#This will create a 2-d array of zeroes of dimensions 3x4
x = np.zeros((3,4))
print(x)
[[ 0.  0.  0.  0.]

[ 0.  0.  0.  0.]]

#This will print the First Row of the 2-d array

x[0].shape gives you the length of the first row. x.shape[0] gives you the first component of the dimensions of 'x', 1024 rows by 10 columns.


x.shape[0] will give the number of rows in an array.

x[0] is 1st row of x so x[0].shape will provide the length of 1st row.
